    <h2> The basic plot line of one piece</h2>
        <p>One peice follows the pirate that goes by the name of Monkey .D Luffy, when he was younger he ate a fruit that turned him into a man made of rubber. The story follows him gathering crewmates to become the king of the pirates.</p>
    <h3>Why it is the best</h3>
        <p>One peice is just the gift that keeps on giving. Everytime i finish a season i think, how could this get any better? And it just keeps getting better. Each season is better than the last in some way. The fact that they can make 1000+ episodes and keep getting better blows my mind. That is why GOAT piece is the best of all time. :)</p>
